### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Microsoft Stock Price with Moving Averages

### Short Description:
This project involves detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Microsoft stock price data to uncover hidden insights. Various visualizations are performed to analyze trends, patterns, and fluctuations. Additionally, we implement Simple Moving Average (SMA), Cumulative Moving Average (CMA), and Exponential Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) to smooth stock price variations. Finally, we determine the maximum and minimum stock prices along with their respective dates to identify key market movements.
